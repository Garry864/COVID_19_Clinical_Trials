## üìñ Project Overview

The dataset comprises records of clinical trials focusing on COVID-19. Each trial contains details like its title, status, interventions, outcome measures, sponsors, and collaborators. This analysis leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques to uncover patterns and derive actionable insights.

## ‚ú® Key Insights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clinical Trial Landscape**
- **Total Trials**: 5,783.
- **Dominant Status**: "Recruiting" trials (2,095), followed by "Not yet recruiting" (1,224).
- **Most Common Trial Phase**: "Unknown," particularly within the "Recruiting" status.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Time Series Trends**
- Most trials were initiated **post-2019**, reflecting the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- A noticeable spike in research activities followed the pandemic's outbreak.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Location Analysis**
- **Top Countries by Trial Count**:
  1. United States: 1,287 trials.
  2. France: 647 trials.
  3. United Kingdom: 585 trials.
- Countries with fewer trials often exhibit higher percentages of missing data in the "Acronym" feature.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Missing Data**
- Features like "Acronym," "Results First Posted," and "Study Documents" have a significant percentage of missing values.
- **Handling Missing Data**:
  - Imputation by a missing indicator.
  - Median imputation for numerical features.
  - "Missing feature" label for categorical variables.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Relationships**
- **Study Status vs. Trial Phase**:
  - "Recruiting" status dominates across various phases.
  - The "Unknown" phase is most prevalent in recruiting trials.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### **Univariate Analysis**
- Examines distributions of individual variables.
- Highlights that "Recruiting" is the most frequent study status.

### **Bivariate Analysis**
- Explores relationships between variables like study status and trial phase.
- Visualizes insights using bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots.

### **Time Series Analysis**
- Tracks the number of trials initiated over time, showing a surge after 2019.

### **Geographical Distribution**
- Extracts country-level information to analyze global research activity.
- Visualized with maps and bar charts for easy interpretation.
